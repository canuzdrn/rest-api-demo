# Demo project for my internship
Simple RESTful API that includes customers, transactions and networks. Kotlin and Springboot technologies are used. I used H2 in memory database with JPA functionality as my database. Also included JUnit5 unit tests using Mockk library. You can clone this project in IntelliJ IDEA and the application will be running at port 8080 as default.
